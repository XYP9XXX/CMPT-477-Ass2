# CMPT-477-Ass2
solving a Sudoku puzzle using Java and Z3 APIs. The program reads a 9×9 Sudoku grid from an input file, where some cells are pre-filled, and determines a solution that satisfies the rules: each digit 1–9 must appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3×3 block. The output is a completed Sudoku grid or "No Solution" if the puzzle is unsolvable. The project includes implementing constraints using Z3 to ensure the rules are met, compiling the program with Maven, and executing it with specific input and output files.
